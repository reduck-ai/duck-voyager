 *
 * A run is read at a stage (`list`, `load`): raw from `runs/` and its transcript, draft from
 * `exports/`, published from `replay/public/data/`. `pnpm replay` serves any stage live
 * (vite.config.ts), the MCP reads any stage (mcp.ts), and the site is built from the published
 * files alone. `pnpm export` drafts a run and `--approve` publishes it (export.ts).
